Project Title: CPU Performance Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes and compares the performance of Intel and AMD CPUs using Power BI. The goal is to provide insights into key performance metrics, trends, and recommendations based on the data. The dataset includes historical performance data, price changes, and benchmarks.


Tools Used:

Power BI (For data visualization and analysis)
Microsoft Excel (For data preprocessing)

Data Cleaning:

Removed missing values.
Standardized metric units (GHz, etc.).
Verified data consistency.


Visualizations:

CPU Performance Over Time: A line chart tracking benchmark scores from both Intel and AMD.
Price-to-Performance Ratio: A bar chart comparing the cost-efficiency of various CPUs.
Other relevant graphs used for deeper insights.


Key Insights:

AMD has shown improved price-to-performance over the last year, especially in multi-threaded workloads.
Intel CPUs still lead in single-core performance, making them suitable for tasks that require high single-thread efficiency.


Conclusion & Recommendations:

AMD processors are recommended for multi-threaded applications (e.g., content creation, servers)
Intel processors perform best in single-threaded scenarios (e.g., gaming, CAD software).
